class UserAdmin(BaseUserAdmin):
    """
    Custom admin interface for the User model.

    Inherits from Django's default UserAdmin but customizes the fieldsets to
    suit the needs of the `User` model in this project.

    Fields:
    -------
    - username: The unique identifier for the user. Used for logging in.
    - password: The hashed password for the user.
    - first_name: The user's first name.
    - last_name: The user's last name.
    - email: The user's email address.
    - is_active: Flag to indicate if the user's account is active.
    - is_staff: Flag to indicate if the user can access the admin site.
    - is_superuser: Flag to indicate if the user has all permissions without being explicitly assigned.
    - groups: Groups the user belongs to. A user will get all permissions granted to each of their groups.
    - user_permissions: Specific permissions for this user.
    - last_login: The last date and time the user logged in.
    - date_joined: The date and time the user registered.

    To further customize this admin class, you can:
    1. Add/Remove fields in the fieldsets attribute.
    2. Override methods like `save_model`, `get_queryset`, etc.
    3. Add custom actions, filters, or inlines.
